### Decrease the possibility you lose the public key

Integrate vanity addresses search
it queries directly from the blockchain
via a web service (github.com/makevoid/vanity_search - to be created soon)




### Increase security

The best thing you should to to maximize security is:

- Pick an old computer (or a Raspberry PI, Cubieboard ...)
- Format the hard drive / SD card
- Install a distribution of linux
- Install VanityUI
- Generate wallet public and private key
- Store the private key in a secure place, separated by the public key, use vanity search for reference
- Hard (slow, low level) format the drive to erase any traces of not completely erased datas

Remember, if you think your private key's security is harmed: Generate a new vanity address, move all the funds there.
